"""Minimum-cost fuel-stop selection (the "gas station problem").

Model (documented assumptions):
  * The vehicle covers ``total_distance`` miles and has a tank holding
    ``range_miles`` of range (500), consuming fuel at ``mpg`` (10) -> a tank of
    range_miles / mpg gallons.
  * It starts and finishes with an EMPTY tank, buying ALL of the trip's fuel
    (total_distance / mpg gallons) at stations along the route. This makes
    "total money spent on fuel" the cost of the whole trip's fuel, and is the
    natural reading of the assignment ("...assuming 10 mpg").
  * Buying must happen at real stations, so the first station's purchase also
    covers the short origin -> first-station lead-in (priced at that station).
    With dense data the first station sits ~mile 0, so this is negligible.
  * Off-route detour fuel is NOT counted (small corridor buffer).

Optimal greedy (Khuller-Malekian-Mestre): standing at a station priced ``p``,
  1. if a strictly-cheaper station is reachable within range -> buy just enough
     to reach the nearest such station (never overbuy expensive fuel);
  2. else if the destination is reachable -> buy exactly enough to finish;
  3. else -> fill the tank (this is a local price minimum) and drive to the
     cheapest reachable station, then re-evaluate.
An exchange argument shows this is globally minimum-cost; tests cross-check it
against an independent linear-program solution.
